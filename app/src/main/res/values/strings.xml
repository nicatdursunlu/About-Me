        I have a few web projects. These are technologies that I use in this projects:
        HTML for main structure, CSS for styling elements, JavaScript to add functionality
        to the project; another technologies that I used for web are
        React(SCSS, styled components for styling element) and Redux for data state management.

        For creating simple page applications, I used React Native(special library of
        JavaScript for cross-platform Mobile Applications),
        Redux and Firebase (as a storage and backend)
